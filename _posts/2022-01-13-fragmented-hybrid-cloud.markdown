### Overview

Recently, geo-distributed data analytics is becoming a well-known method to process and manage the big data generated from globally distributed data. The ability to analyze and process geo-distributed data has become an important and challenging mission in many domains. Many applications need to process and analyze a massive amount of geo-distributed data. For instance, a bioinformatics application that analyzes existing genomes in different laboratories, a system to monitor, analyze log files from distributed servers, or any recommendation system. Today, the well-known cloud providers unify the management of infrastructure and application across public and on-premises. AWS, Google, and Azure Stack hyper-converged infrastructure are examples of hybrid cloud solutions that seamlessly allow users to exploit native public cloud services on premises in a variety of form factors with the help of public cloud APIs. The widespread usage of resource-constrained mobile devices and mobile edge objects including resource-moderated incentive academia and industries sector to investigate the management of fragmented resources between connected between mobile devices/objects in cloud environments. Our primary focus of fragmented hybrid clouds is to enable distributed databases and big data analytical frameworks to connect with a single computing service, which underneath leverage several Geo-distributed private cloud services.
