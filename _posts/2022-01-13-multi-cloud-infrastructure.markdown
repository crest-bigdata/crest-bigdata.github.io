### Overview

Cloud computing is the mainstream delivery of on-demand and easy-to-use services such as computing, networking, storage, databases, and software over the Internet. It provides a pay-per-usage model in which consumers typically pay for cloud services they use. Cloud computing comes into three models: public, private and hydrid. A public cloud provides computing, storage and networking resources to the general public over Internet while a private cloud facilitates resources of on-premises infrastructure for the dedicated use of a specific organization. A hybrid cloud is a seamless integration of public and private clouds to take the best of both worlds. It enables cloud bursting in which applications initially leverage private cloud and burst into a public cloud when private resources are not enough to provision under spiking workload. A hybrid cloud significantly benefits its owner in terms of security in compliance with the location of sensitive data, availability, reliability, and cost reduction. However, construction of hybrid clouds and deployment of applications on top of them are not trivial tasks. [what you are currenlty working on â€¦]
