<p style="text-align: justify;">
With the rapid increase in digital technology, the scale of data available to human society is proliferating and we have moved from collecting small samples of clean data to collecting large volume of structured and unstructured streaming data. This gave rise to Big Data, which refers to large or complex datasets which are beyond the limits of traditional databases to capture, manage or process with low latency. However, with the availability of powerful processing hardware, huge inexpensive memories, and cloud computing has enabled big data analytics to examine large amounts of data to find insights, derive conclusions, and to support data-driven decision making. By taking advantage of these technologies, we have developed the CREST big data platform which allows users to analyse data effortlessly without having the hassle of assembling or configuring of sophisticated hardware or software.

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Our platform provides a comprehensive, flexible, and scalable ecosystem of frameworks and functionalities that allows capturing, processing, analysis, and visualization of large volumes of data. By providing data analytics as service, it allows analysts, researchers, and business users to make better and faster decisions using data that was previously inaccessible or unusable. By utilizing advanced analytics techniques such as machine learning, deep learning, predictive analytics, classification and pattern mining, the users can gain valuable insights from previously unusable data sources independently or together with other previously existing data.
